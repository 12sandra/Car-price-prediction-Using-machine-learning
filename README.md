A Machine Learning–powered web application that predicts the resale price of a car based on user inputs such as present price, kilometers driven, age, fuel type, seller type, and transmission.
The app is built using Python, Flask, and Scikit-learn

Project Overview

Predicting car resale prices is a common real-world regression problem.
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ML workflow, including:

Data preprocessing & feature engineering

Model training and evaluation

Model serialization using Pickle

Deployment using Flask

Machine Learning Model

Algorithm Used: Random Forest Regressor (Hyperparameter Tuned)

Target Variable: Selling_Price

Evaluation Metric: R² Score (~0.95 after tuning)

Feature Scaling: StandardScaler
